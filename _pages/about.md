Hello! My name is Md Mubtasim Ahasan. I am working as a Junior Research Scientist at the [Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS)](https://ccds.ai), Independent University, Bangladesh. My research is supervised by [Prof. Amin Ahsan Ali](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/aminali) and [Prof. AKM Mahbubur Rahman](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/akmmrahman).

Currently, my research focuses on audio and speech tokenization and synthesis, multimodal learning, representation learning and alignment, and large language model (LLM)-powered agents with tool learning. I am fortunate to collaborate with and receive mentorship from [Md Mofijul Islam](https://mmiakashs.github.io/), [Aman Chadha](https://www.aman.info/), and [Tasnim Mohiuddin](https://taasnim.github.io/).

Previously, my undergraduate research, supervised by [Prof. Jannatun Noor](https://sites.google.com/site/jannatun0abigzero/home) at the [C2SG Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Computing-for-Sustainability-and-Social-Good-C2SG-Lab-Jannatun-Noor) focused on computer vision and audio signal processing for medical applications. I completed my Bachelor's from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering), [Brac University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/).

I am actively seeking research collaborations and Ph.D. opportunities.
