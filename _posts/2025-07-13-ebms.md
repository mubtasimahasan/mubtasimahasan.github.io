**Review of Two Papers on Energy-Based Models (EBMs)**  
- **Paper 1:** [Energy-Based Transformers are Scalable Learners and Thinkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02092)  
- **Paper 2:** [Learning Iterative Reasoning through Energy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15448)

### 1. Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs)  
This work introduces **Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs)**, a new class of EBMs that assign energy values to input–prediction pairs. Predictions are obtained through **gradient descent-based energy minimization**, reframing inference as an optimization process.  

EBTs scale efficiently across both discrete (text) and continuous (vision) modalities. Compared to standard Transformer++ architectures, they achieve **faster scaling (up to 35%)** with respect to parameters, data, and compute, and deliver improved inference-time reasoning. On language tasks, EBTs enhance performance by **29%** under a System 2 Thinking setup. On vision, they outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while requiring fewer forward passes.  

Overall, EBTs present a **general, unsupervised framework for System 2-style reasoning**, offering stronger generalization across downstream tasks compared to conventional approaches.

### 2. Learning Iterative Reasoning through Energy Minimization  
This earlier work proposes a framework where reasoning is formulated as **energy minimization**. A neural network parameterizes an energy landscape over candidate outputs, and reasoning proceeds iteratively by descending this landscape toward low-energy solutions.  

The key insight is that **harder problems correspond to more complex energy landscapes**. By allocating more optimization steps to these cases, the system effectively performs **adaptive computation**, mirroring how humans “think longer” on more difficult problems. Empirical results show improved performance on algorithmic reasoning tasks in both graph-based and continuous domains, including problems requiring **nested reasoning**.

### My Notes  
These two works illustrate the potential of **energy-based models as reasoning engines**:  
- **EBTs** demonstrate that energy-based formulations can scale to large Transformer architectures, improving both training efficiency and inference-time reasoning.  
- **Iterative energy minimization** provides a conceptual foundation for adaptive, step-by-step reasoning, aligning with human-like problem-solving.  

Together, they suggest a promising direction: **reframing inference as optimization**, where computation is dynamically allocated based on task difficulty. The presentation slides are shared below.
